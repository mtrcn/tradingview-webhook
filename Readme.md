docker build -t tradingview-webhook-api .
```

### 4. Run the Docker Container

Run the container and map port 5000:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env tradingview-webhook-api
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:8000.

### Webhook Endpoint

The application exposes a `/webhook` endpoint to accept trading signals. Send a POST request to this endpoint with the following JSON payload:

```json
{
  "secret": "your_webhook_secret",
  "action": "buy",
  "symbol": "BTC-USDC",
  "exchange": "coinbase"
}
```

**Fields**:
- `secret`: The webhook secret (must match WEBHOOK_SECRET in .env).
- `action`: The trading action (buy or sell).
- `symbol`: The trading pair (e.g., BTC-USDC).
- `exchange`: The exchange to use (e.g., coinbase).

**Example cURL Request**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "secret": "your_webhook_secret",
        "action": "buy",
        "symbol": "BTC-USDC",
        "exchange": "coinbase"
      }'
```
